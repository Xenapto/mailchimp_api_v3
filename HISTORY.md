### v0.2.13
    * Refreshed Rubocop and ensured the code is still compliant
    * Changed copyright to me

### v0.2.0
    * Updated the dependency on rest-client to 2.0.0 because of the known vulnerabilities in earlier versions
    * The corollary of this is that Ruby versions < 2.0 are no longer supported
